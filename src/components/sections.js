                    The installation process for this project is a bit more than usual.
                    <br/> First we have to download a C++ compiler.<br/>
                    We can do this by installing Visual Studios.
                    <br/>You can download the community version for free from their website.<br/>
                    Once the installers we will run it and select the ‘Desktop development with C++’.<br/>
                    The download and installation will take some time as it is a few Gbs.<br/>
                    After completing and restarting the computer, now we will head on to our PyCharm project.<br/>
                    Here we will install the required packages. Below is the list.
                        <ul>

                    Machine learning algorithms are used to train facial recognition systems to identify faces in images or video footage. <br/>
                    These algorithms analyze large datasets of labeled images to learn patterns and features that are indicative of facial features and structures.<br/>
                    It is subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focus on developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.<br/>
                    It refers to the process of training algorithms to learn patterns and relationships in data. <br/>
                    This involves providing the algorithm with a large dataset of labeled examples and then using various techniques to learn patterns and relationships in the data. <br/>
                    Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unlabeled data.

                    Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
                    <br/> It uses artificial neural networks to learn and model complex patterns in data.<br/>
                    is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks.<br/>
                    Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective for tasks that involve complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, such as image or speech recognition.<br/>
                    <span>The key difference between </span>machine learning and deep learning is the level of complexity and the types of problems that they can address. <br/>
                    Machine learning algorithms are generally simpler and more interpretable, but they may not be as effective for complex problems.<br/>
                    Deep learning algorithms are more complex and powerful, but they may be more difficult to train and interpret.
                    <br/>One of<span> the key advantages</span> of deep learning is its ability to automatically extract useful features from raw data, without the need for manual feature engineering.
                    <br/>This makes it particularly useful for handling large and complex datasets, where it can discover hidden patterns and relationships that might be difficult for humans to identify.

            <div>
                <p>
                    NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.<br/>
                    It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, 
                    fourier transform, and matrices.<br/>
                    NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source 
                    project and you can use it freely.<br/>
                    NumPy stands for Numerical Python.<br/>
                    <span>Why Use NumPy?</span><br/>
                    In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they 
                    are slow to process.<br/>
                    NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than 
                    traditional Python lists.<br/>
                    The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of 
                    supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.<br/>
                    Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and 
                    resources are very important.<br/>
                    NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike 
                    lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.<br/>
                    This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.<br/>
                    This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is 
                    optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

                    Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.<br/> It has 
                    functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.<br/>
                    The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and 
                    "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.<br/>
                    <span>Why Use Pandas?</span><br/>
                    Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based 
                    on statistical theories.<br/>
                    Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and 
                    relevant.<br/>
                    Relevant data is very important in data science.<br/>
                    <span>What Can Pandas Do?</span>
                    <br/>
                    Pandas gives you answers about the data. Like:
                    <ul>
                    <li>Is there a correlation between two or more columns?</li>
                    <li>What is average value?</li>
                    <li>Max value?</li>
                    <li>Min value?</li>
                    </ul>

                    Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or 
                    contains wrong values, like empty or NULL values.<br/> This is 
                    called cleaning the data.

is a module that is used to style the tkinter widgets.<br/> Just like CSS is 
used to style an HTML element, we use tkinter.ttk to style tkinter 
widgets. <br/>The tkinter.ttk module contains all the new ttk widgets. <br/>
It’s a good practice to always use themed widgets whenever they’re 
available.<br/>
Tkinter has two generations of widgets:
<ul>
    <li>The old classic tk widgets. Tkinter introduced them in 1991.</li>
    <li>The newer themed ttk widgets added in 2007 with Tk 8.5. The </li>

newer Tk themed widgets replace many (but not all) classic 
widgets.

                    first preference for real-time object detection.<br/>
                    YOLOv4 was introduced with some astounding new things, It 
                    outperformed YOLOv3 with a high margin and also has a significant

                <p>
                    FaceNet provides a unique architecture for performing 
                    tasks like face recognition, verification and clustering.<br/> It 
                    uses deep convolutional networks along with triplet loss 
                    to achieve state of the art accuracy.<br/>
                    The main difference between FaceNet and other techniques is that it 
                    learns the mapping from the images and creates embeddings rather 
                    than using any bottleneck layer for recognition or verification tasks. <br/>
                    Once the embeddings are created all the other tasks like verification, 
                    recognition etc. <br/>can be performed using standard techniques of that 
                    particular domain, using these newly generated embeddings as the 
                    feature vector. <br/>For example we can use k-NN for face recognition by 
                    using embeddings as the feature vector and similarly we can use any 
                    clustering technique for clustering the faces together and for 
                    verification we just need to define a threshold value.
