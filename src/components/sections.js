                <p>
                    The installation process for this project is a bit more than usual.
                    <br/> First we have to download a C++ compiler.<br/>
                    We can do this by installing Visual Studios.
                    <br/>You can download the community version for free from their website.<br/>
                    Once the installers we will run it and select the ‘Desktop development with C++’.<br/>
                    The download and installation will take some time as it is a few Gbs.<br/>
                    After completing and restarting the computer, now we will head on to our PyCharm project.<br/>
                    Here we will install the required packages. Below is the list.
                        <ul>

                    It can use your existing hardware infrastructure, existing camaras and image capture Devices will work with no problems 
                    <br/>In Facial recognition there are two types of comparisons:-<br/>
                    1 - <span>VERIFICATION</span>- The system compares the given individual with who they say 	they are and gives a yes or no decision. <br/>
                    2 - <span>IDENTIFICATION</span>- The system compares the given individual to all the 	Other individuals in the database and gives a ranked list of matches.

                    Machine learning algorithms are used to train facial recognition systems to identify faces in images or video footage. <br/>
                    These algorithms analyze large datasets of labeled images to learn patterns and features that are indicative of facial features and structures.<br/>
                    It is subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focus on developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.<br/>
                    It refers to the process of training algorithms to learn patterns and relationships in data. <br/>
                    This involves providing the algorithm with a large dataset of labeled examples and then using various techniques to learn patterns and relationships in the data. <br/>
                    Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unlabeled data.

                    Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
                    <br/> It uses artificial neural networks to learn and model complex patterns in data.<br/>
                    is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks.<br/>
                    Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective for tasks that involve complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, such as image or speech recognition.<br/>
                    <span>The key difference between </span>machine learning and deep learning is the level of complexity and the types of problems that they can address. <br/>
                    Machine learning algorithms are generally simpler and more interpretable, but they may not be as effective for complex problems.<br/>
                    Deep learning algorithms are more complex and powerful, but they may be more difficult to train and interpret.
                    <br/>One of<span> the key advantages</span> of deep learning is its ability to automatically extract useful features from raw data, without the need for manual feature engineering.
                    <br/>This makes it particularly useful for handling large and complex datasets, where it can discover hidden patterns and relationships that might be difficult for humans to identify.
