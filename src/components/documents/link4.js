                    Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
                    <br/> It uses artificial neural networks to learn and model complex patterns in data.<br/>
                    is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks.<br/>
                    Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective for tasks that involve complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs, such as image or speech recognition.<br/>
                    <span>The key difference between </span>machine learning and deep learning is the level of complexity and the types of problems that they can address. <br/>
                    Machine learning algorithms are generally simpler and more interpretable, but they may not be as effective for complex problems.<br/>
                    Deep learning algorithms are more complex and powerful, but they may be more difficult to train and interpret.
                    <br/>One of<span> the key advantages</span> of deep learning is its ability to automatically extract useful features from raw data, without the need for manual feature engineering.
                    <br/>This makes it particularly useful for handling large and complex datasets, where it can discover hidden patterns and relationships that might be difficult for humans to identify.
