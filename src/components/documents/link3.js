                    Machine learning algorithms are used to train facial recognition systems to identify faces in images or video footage. <br/>
                    These algorithms analyze large datasets of labeled images to learn patterns and features that are indicative of facial features and structures.<br/>
                    It is subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focus on developing algorithms and models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.<br/>
                    It refers to the process of training algorithms to learn patterns and relationships in data. <br/>
                    This involves providing the algorithm with a large dataset of labeled examples and then using various techniques to learn patterns and relationships in the data. <br/>
                    Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unlabeled data.
