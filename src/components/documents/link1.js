                    The installation process for this project is a bit more than usual.
                    <br/> First we have to download a C++ compiler.<br/>
                    We can do this by installing Visual Studios.
                    <br/>You can download the community version for free from their website.<br/>
                    Once the installers we will run it and select the ‘Desktop development with C++’.<br/>
                    The download and installation will take some time as it is a few Gbs.<br/>
                    After completing and restarting the computer, now we will head on to our PyCharm project.<br/>
                    Here we will install the required packages. Below is the list.
                        <ul>
                        <li>cmake</li>
                        <li>dlib </li>
                        <li>face_recognition </li>
                        <li>numpy </li>
                        <li>opencv-python</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
